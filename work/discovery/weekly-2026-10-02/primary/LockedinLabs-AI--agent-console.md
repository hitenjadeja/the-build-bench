| | |
|---|---|
| **Local-first** | Reads the agents' own transcripts on your machines. No telemetry, no update check, no crash reporting — see [data flows](docs/security/DATA-FLOWS.md). |
| **Every machine, one view** | Join laptops, build boxes and servers to a self-hosted team hub; each machine keeps its own lanes and nothing is counted twice. |
| **Gateway and telemetry aware** | Optional ingest of Claude Code OpenTelemetry and Kong or LiteLLM token metrics, a Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint and a [Grafana dashboard](docs/grafana-agent-console.json). |
| **Honest numbers** | Estimates say they are estimates; unknown readings are shown as unknown, never as zero. |
| **Safe to present** | Presenting mode (P) replaces every project, machine and person with a stand-in name. |
| **Verifiable supply chain** | Apple-signed and notarized macOS builds, `SHA256SUMS`, signed build attestations and, from 0.4.1, a CycloneDX SBOM on every release ([verify one](#verify-a-release)); [threat model](docs/security/THREAT-MODEL.md), [NIST SSDF mapping](docs/security/SSDF.md) and an [enterprise security FAQ](docs/security/ENTERPRISE-FAQ.md). |

**Installing with Claude Code or Codex?** Give it this repository's URL and ask
it to follow [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md). The same guide works if you prefer to
install it yourself: choose the current source, an npm archive, or a standalone
download, then verify the version and open the console.

This page describes **v0.4.1**, published as the
[v0.4.1 release](https://github.com/LockedinLabs-AI/agent-console/releases/tag/v0.4.1)
and as the source on `main`. Run from source to use the current console:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/LockedinLabs-AI/agent-console.git
cd agent-console
node bin/agent-console.mjs --open
```

You need Git and Node.js 22 or newer, or use [Download ZIP](#start-here)
instead of Git. There is no account to create, no package install and no build
step. The command runs this checkout, reads the Claude Code and Codex history already on
this computer, and opens the console in your browser, signed in, normally at
`http://127.0.0.1:6787`. To look around first without reading anything of
yours, add `--demo` before `--open`.

**In the first thirty seconds you see:** the last 24 hours of tokens (or the
last hour, 7 days or 30 days), split into cache read, cache write, output and
uncached input; their list-price estimate;
burn right now, in tokens per minute and dollars per hour; one lane per
session with its model, its subagents and its last hour of activity; and every
machine and person reporting, each with a share of the total.

**Nothing leaves a machine but counts.** Only model ids, minute timestamps,
token counts and salted hashes, and never a prompt, a reply, a file path or a
file's contents. A test pushes transcripts full of planted canaries through
the real reporter and the real hub and checks every byte that crosses the wire.
The console itself sends nothing anywhere: no telemetry, no update check, no
account. (Three opt-ins, each off unless you pass it: `--share-project-names`
sends each project folder's *name*, never its path; `--share-alerts` and
`--share-tool-activity` send alerts and tool calls as kinds and counts.)

## Install

The [installation guide](INSTALL.md) covers all three routes and what to do
after closing the console. Downloads live in
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/LockedinLabs-AI/agent-console/releases/latest).
There is no separate desktop installer or hosted dashboard to sign up for;
the executable starts the console in your browser.

Choose a version as well as an installation method:

| Channel | Current availability |
| --- | --- |
| Source on main | v0.4.1 source. Use Node.js 22+ and the commands above, or Download ZIP below. |
| GitHub release downloads | [v0.4.1](https://github.com/LockedinLabs-AI/agent-console/releases/tag/v0.4.1) has a Node.js package and standalone files for macOS, Linux and Windows. |
| npm registry | `@lockedinlabs/agent-console` is not published. Use the source checkout or a published GitHub release archive. |
| Homebrew | The documented tap has not been verified as available. Use source or the listed GitHub release. |
| Published container image | A v0.4.1 image has not been verified. Do not assume the source version is an available image tag. |

**Prefer `npm install`?** npm can install a published GitHub archive even while
the registry name is unavailable. For the currently published **v0.4.1**:

```sh
npm install --global --ignore-scripts https://github.com/LockedinLabs-AI/agent-console/releases/download/v0.4.1/lockedinlabs-agent-console-0.4.1.tgz
agent-console --open
```

In Windows PowerShell use `npm.cmd` and `agent-console.cmd`.
If npm reports a permission error, use the source route; administrator access
is unnecessary.

<details>
<summary>v0.4.1 package commands — only after its release is published</summary>

These commands require `lockedinlabs-agent-console-0.4.1.tgz` to be listed
on the [release page](https://github.com/LockedinLabs-AI/agent-console/releases).
Until that file is published, use the source instructions above.

```sh
npx --yes https://github.com/LockedinLabs-AI/agent-console/releases/download/v0.4.1/lockedinlabs-agent-console-0.4.1.tgz --open
```

In Windows PowerShell, use `npx.cmd` because the default policy can refuse
`npx`'s script form:

```powershell
npx.cmd --yes https://github.com/LockedinLabs-AI/agent-console/releases/download/v0.4.1/lockedinlabs-agent-console-0.4.1.tgz --open
```

</details>

Published files can be checked against the release's `SHA256SUMS` and build
attestation ([Verify a release](#verify-a-release)). Consult that
version's release notes for its signing status. The Windows executable is
not code-signed; Node.js can run the source without installing that executable.

**Behind a proxy or TLS inspection.** `npx`, `npm` and `curl` use
`HTTPS_PROXY`; Node.js's own downloads, such as the check at the start of a
join command, use it only with `NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1` as well (Node.js 22.21
or newer). Where the network inspects TLS, point Node.js at your company's
root certificate with `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=<file>.pem`. A join command that
stops with `fetch failed` on a company network needs these
([details](docs/standalone-install.md#behind-a-proxy)).

**To remove it**, see [Uninstall](#uninstall).

## Start here

You need a Mac, a Linux machine or a Windows PC, and about two minutes.

1. **Install Node.js 22 or newer.** Get the LTS version from
   [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org). To check, open a terminal (*Terminal* on a
   Mac, *PowerShell* on Windows) and type `node --version` — it should say
   `v22` or higher.
   Without Node.js, the published v0.4.1 standalone downloads run this
   console; see [Install](#install).
2. **Start it.** Paste this into the terminal and press Return:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/LockedinLabs-AI/agent-console.git
   cd agent-console
   node bin/agent-console.mjs --open
   ```

   The same commands work in Windows PowerShell. They require Git; the
   Download ZIP instructions below work without it.

   That starts the source checkout and opens it in your browser, signed in, normally at
   `http://127.0.0.1:6787`. If that port is taken, the terminal prints the
   address it used instead. Leave the terminal window open; closing it (or
   pressing Ctrl+C) stops the console. The same command starts it again.

   The first start reads the Claude Code and Codex history already on this
   computer. With months of it that can take a minute; the terminal counts the
   files as it goes, and so does the console.

**No Node.js?** The [v0.4.1 release](https://github.com/LockedinLabs-AI/agent-console/releases/tag/v0.4.1)
carries standalone executables with Node.js inside. Use
[the installation instructions](docs/standalone-install.md)
and [check the downloaded file](#verify-a-release).

**Or download it.** On the [GitHub page](https://github.com/LockedinLabs-AI/agent-console),
press the green **Code** button, then **Download ZIP**, and unzip it. You get a
folder called `agent-console-main`. In a terminal, go into that folder and
start the console:

```sh
cd ~/Downloads/agent-console-main
node bin/agent-console.mjs --open
```

On Windows (PowerShell) the first line is `cd $HOME\Downloads\agent-console-main`.
If `node` then says it cannot find `bin/agent-console.mjs`, Windows unzipped
the folder inside another one of the same name: run `cd agent-console-main`
once more. (If you use git: `git clone https://github.com/LockedinLabs-AI/agent-console.git`,
then `cd agent-console`.)

**The .tgz on the release page.** The [releases page](https://github.com/LockedinLabs-AI/agent-console/releases/latest)
lists a file named `lockedinlabs-agent-console-<version>.tgz`. It is the
packaged console for that release; it does not track main. *Source code (zip)*
on the same page is that
release's code, used the same way as Download ZIP (its folder is named
`agent-console-<version>`).

The rest of this page writes commands as `node bin/agent-console.mjs`. If you
use a published package, put `npx --yes <that release link>` in its place,
and consult that version's README for supported features.

Nothing to install beyond Node, no account, no build step, no dependencies.

To look around before it reads anything of yours:
`node bin/agent-console.mjs --demo --open` shows a synthetic team of five
machines. Everything on that screen is stamped **DEMO**.

### Add another computer

A teammate's laptop, your second machine, a second user account on this one:
each reports to the same console and they all add up.

1. Start the console so other computers on your network can reach it:

   ```sh
   node bin/agent-console.mjs --listen 0.0.0.0 --open
   ```

   Other computers reach it on the next port (normally `6788`); the console
   itself stays on this computer only (see
   [How the machines connect](#how-the-machines-connect)).
2. In the console, press **Add a machine**. Say whose machine it is and what to
   call it, press **Create join link**, then **Copy link**.
3. Until v0.4.1 packages are published, use a current source checkout on the
   other computer and run `node bin/agent-console.mjs join '<join link>'`,
   replacing `<join link>` with the copied link. The join travels encrypted,
   checked against your console's certificate. The generated **Copy command**
   requires the corresponding GitHub release package; it does not transfer
   the source checkout from your computer.

The machine appears on your console within seconds, and the console shows who
joined and when. A join link works **once**, for at most an hour. On the
screen the link and its code stay masked; **Copy** puts them on the clipboard.

![Add a machine: choose its owner and name, then create a single-use join link](docs/console-demo-join-dark.png)

![The Team view in demo mode, light](docs/console-demo-team-light.png)

![The Projects view in demo mode, dark: this machine's projects, their Git figures and the sessions behind them](docs/console-demo-projects-dark.png)

**Presenting.** Press `P` (or choose *Present* in ⌘K) before sharing a screen:
every project, branch, machine and person becomes a stable stand-in name
(project A, machine 1), the estimates and the console's addresses step back,
and the strip reads PRESENTING. Press `P` again to stop.

![The Console presenting: stand-in names, no estimates](docs/console-demo-presenting-dark.png)

### Signing in

The console only shows its figures to a browser that has signed in. `--open`
opens it signed in. Otherwise the terminal prints a sign-in link when the
console starts; it works once. To sign in again later, for example in another
browser, run the start command again with `--open`: it sees the console is
already running and opens it signed in. Each browser gets its own session,
which lasts 30 days; **Sign out**, at the foot of the console, ends it.

### What works where

| | macOS | Linux | Windows |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The console, reading this computer | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Joining and reporting to another computer's console | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Projects view (Git evidence) | Yes, with `git` | Yes, with `git` | Yes, with `git` |

CI runs the whole test suite, including the multi-process privacy test, and the
package smoke test on macOS, Linux and Windows, with Node 22 and 24.

Windows: use PowerShell, and when Windows asks whether Node.js may accept
connections on the machine running the console, allow it on private networks.

## What you see

**Tokens · last 24 hours**, or the last hour, 7 days or 30 days from the period
switch: the total across every machine, the list-price estimate, the number of
messages (API responses, not transcript lines), and the split into **cache
read**, **cache write** (by cache lifetime), **output** and **uncached input**,
each with its share of all tokens. The chart, the model list and the machine
list follow the same period, and the chart's bars add up to the headline. 30
days come from daily totals the console keeps for 400 days. Transcript lines
that carry usage but could not be counted are counted by reason and shown
beside the figures, never silently dropped. (Cache read as a share of *input tokens only*, the
other common reading, is in the cache-read tooltip, labelled as such.)

**Tokens over time**: the last hour, day, week or 30 days. Where a machine has stopped
reporting, the chart says from when it is incomplete.

**By model** and **by machine**: each model's share and spend over the period,
with real Anthropic and OpenAI marks, and each machine's share, tokens and
estimate, one row each, a silent machine saying since when.

**Attention**: the one thing that needs it — a burn spike, spending without
progress, a repeated tool call, an unpriced model in the estimate, a silent
machine — or, when nothing does, that nothing does.

**Spend spectrum**: the estimate's share by class over the tokens' share by
class, so a small share of tokens that is a large share of the money shows as
such; then each model's share of the money over its share of the tokens.

**Burn · last 60 min**: tokens per minute (or per second) right now, averaged
over the last fifteen minutes so one burst of agent traffic does not swing it,
the dollars per hour it implies, and the last sixty minutes drawn one bar per
minute with their median.

**Lanes**: one row per session: whether it is live, the project and branch, the
model, its last hour of activity, tokens in the last five minutes, uncached
input and output for the day, the day's tokens and their estimate, how many
subagents it is running, its context, which machine it is on and when it last
reported. The rest of the day folds under the lanes: cold sessions, projects,
effort and what was shipped.

**Context and cache health**: the Context column shows the latest complete
input reading for an API response in each session. Open it to see the last 16
readings, growth, and possible cache breaks. A session is flagged when a
reading reaches 160,000 input tokens, or when it reaches 80,000 and doubles
from the first retained reading. The hub keeps at most 128 recent readings per
session. Streaming continuation rows are excluded, so some responses without
a complete first reading cannot be shown. A gap past the previous write's
known lifetime (five minutes or one hour), followed by a new cache write and
falling cache reads, is marked an idle-gap signal. With an unknown lifetime,
the drill-down says so; a large write within a known lifetime is marked a
possible prefix rewrite. The logs do not prove the cause. Extra cost is an estimate of the
observed cache write over a hypothetical cache read, using the offline price
table version and check date shown in the drill-down. Unpriced estimates stay
unknown. In `--demo`, the existing docs-site lane includes a synthetic break.

### Optional telemetry and metrics

Start with `--interop` to enable a local Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint and
local ingest of Claude Code OpenTelemetry and Kong or LiteLLM token metrics.
The console shows those readings in a Telemetry panel, separate from the
transcript totals so the same request is never added twice. It is off for
ordinary users. The synthetic demo shows an OpenTelemetry reading. See
[setup, accepted formats and privacy rules](docs/INTEROP.md); the included
[Grafana dashboard](docs/grafana-agent-console.json) can read `/metrics`.
`/metrics` and ingest require separate credentials: `metrics-token --scope read`
for scrapers and `metrics-token --scope ingest` for exporters. Add `--rotate`
to revoke and replace one scope without restarting the console.

### Shared analysis core

The dependency-free analysis functions are available to other Node.js consumers
through the versioned `@lockedinlabs/agent-console/analysis` subpath:

```js
import { ANALYSIS_VERSION, contextHealth } from '@lockedinlabs/agent-console/analysis';
const health = contextHealth(samples, prices);
```

The package is not on the npm registry, and the v0.4.1 archive is not
published yet. To use the current analysis API, install a local source
checkout into your project with `npm install /path/to/agent-console`,
replacing the path with your checkout's location.

`ANALYSIS_VERSION` is 1. `contextHealth` accepts only plain usage data:
`samples` contains timestamps, token counts and model IDs; `prices` contains
offline model rates, table version and check date. It returns a plain object
with context weight, growth, possible cache breaks and estimated extra cost.
No transcript text, paths, names or credentials enter the core. The console
uses this same subpath. See [the API contract](docs/ANALYSIS.md) for fields
and unknown-value behavior.

**Live alerts**: as new local Claude Code or Codex transcript lines arrive,
Agent Console flags repeated identical tool calls, a response spending at least
50,000 tokens and three times its session's recent median, and 500,000 tokens
spent over five minutes without an observed successful tool result. A repeated
call needs five matching tool-and-argument hashes. These are signals, not proof
that work is stuck. The alert panel covers this machine; alerts remain local
and expire from the panel after an hour. `--demo` includes synthetic examples.
Use `--alert-repeat`, `--alert-spike-factor`, and `--alert-stall-minutes` to
change the thresholds. Add `--desktop-alerts` to opt in to native macOS,
Linux, or Windows notifications; they name the signal but never include tool
arguments. The existing collector tail checks for new lines every two seconds,
and the UI polls every two seconds. The alerts use the collector's counted
token deltas and salted session identities, including distinct subagents; they
do not rescan transcripts or recompute Codex usage. In a synthetic five-call
append through the local collector on this machine, the alert appeared after
2,043 ms; the next UI poll can add up to two seconds. That is an observation,
not a latency guarantee.
The pure detection rules are exported from the shared analysis subpath.

**Agent tree**: open the Agents count in a lane to see the orchestrator and
its observed subagents in place. Each row shows its model, tokens observed in
the last 24 hours, and the span between its first and last reported records.
Outcome is **unknown · no result recorded** until a result is available in the
privacy-safe record format; activity or a tool call is not treated as success.
The synthetic team includes parent and child sessions. The same count-only
tree builder is exported from the shared analysis subpath.

**Team**: every machine and every person: tokens, share of the
total, cache read and write shares, model split and cost, for the same periods as the headline; every join link, who used it and when. Two machines with the same
person roll up into one row.

**Projects**: this computer only: tokens per project, and what Git recorded in
the same period (commits, lines changed, and commits referencing a pull request
or issue number). Git figures count only commits by this computer's Git email
(`user.email`); where none is set, the page says it counts every author. It is
read on this computer and never sent anywhere.

**Spend in the window of the work**: Projects also shows estimated spend per
local commit and per integration into a locally known default branch. The
denominator is Git evidence in the selected period (1 hour to 30 days); the
numerator is this machine's usage estimate in that same window. These are
correlations, not attribution to a commit or a merge. Squash subjects with a
pull-request number and merge commits on the default branch count as
integrations. A missing default-branch ref, zero outcomes or any unpriced
usage leaves the ratio unknown, shown as a dash. No GitHub token or network
request is involved. The synthetic team includes demonstration ratios.

### What the numbers promise

- **A machine that stops reporting is not zero.** It shows when it was last
  heard from, its sessions show an unknown five-minute figure, and it is left out
  of "right now" by name.
- **A machine still sending its history is not complete.** A computer that
  joins with months of transcripts shows "catching up · N of M records" until
  everything has arrived, and is left out of "right now" until then. If its
  upload is interrupted it carries on from where it stopped.
- **Unknown is not zero.** A record that did not report a token class makes the
  total a floor, and the screen says so. A model with no verified list price is
  left out of the dollar figure, never priced at $0, and the screen says how
  many tokens that leaves out. If everything in the burn window is unpriced,
  the burn shows "—/hour · unpriced" rather than a dollar rate.
- **Copied transcripts count once.** Record ids come from the transcript itself,
  not from where the file sits, so the same session read on two machines is one
  set of events.
- **Dollars are estimates** at standard API list prices from a dated, offline
  table (`lib/collector/prices.json`). They are not an invoice and not a
  subscription charge. Tokens measure usage, not productivity.
- **Demo is never mixed with measured data.** A console started with `--demo`
  reads nothing, accepts no machine, and stamps DEMO on every view.

The full definitions are in [docs/MEASUREMENTS.md](docs/MEASUREMENTS.md). The
accounting rules for people, teams, models and sessions, and the conformance
suite that checks them to the token, are in [docs/accounting.md](docs/accounting.md).

## Project policy

Add `agent-policy.yaml` at your repository root. From that root, run the
source checkout's command, replacing `/path/to/agent-console` with its
location:

```sh
node "/path/to/agent-console/bin/agent-console.mjs" policy diff
node "/path/to/agent-console/bin/agent-console.mjs" policy apply
node "/path/to/agent-console/bin/agent-console.mjs" policy remove
```

`policy diff` shows the proposed Claude Code agents, settings and hooks;
`policy apply` installs those project files with private backups; `policy
remove` restores what was there before and deletes what apply created.
`policy --help` prints the usage. All three refuse a symlinked `.claude` path and never write your
user-level Claude settings. The installed hook decides within five seconds,
and asks or denies when it cannot classify a command in time. Nothing is
installed by starting the dashboard. The optional policy covers model roles,
effort, action gates, and budget thresholds; hard token and dollar budget
enforcement is not available from the native launch hook. See
[the policy format and current enforcement limits](docs/policy.md).

## How the machines connect

One computer runs the console: the **hub**. Every other computer runs a small
**reporter** that reads *its own* Claude Code and Codex transcripts and sends the
hub metadata every ten seconds.

```
  laptop ── reporter ──┐   TLS, pinned            ┌── the console: 127.0.0.1:6787, signed in
                       ├── reporting port 6788 ──> hub
  workstation ─ reporter ┘  (device token)         └── reads its own transcripts too
```

**Two ports.** The console, its data and every button on it (making links,
removing machines) are on `127.0.0.1:6787`: this computer only, whatever
`--listen` says, and only for a signed-in browser. Other computers talk to the
reporting port, `6788`, which serves only the join page, the join exchange and
reporting. By default it listens on this computer only; `--listen 0.0.0.0` (or
a specific address) opens it to your network. It accepts callers on private
networks only (home and office ranges, IPv6 unique-local) unless you pass
`--allow-public`. Tailscale's addresses (100.64.0.0/10) are shared with
strangers on carrier-grade NAT, so they count only with `--allow-cgnat`. To look at the console from elsewhere, tunnel to it:
`ssh -L 6787:127.0.0.1:6787 you@hub-computer`, then open `http://127.0.0.1:6787`.

**Encrypted and pinned.** The console makes its own TLS certificate the first
time it starts, and every join link carries that certificate's fingerprint.
Joining and reporting go over TLS, and the reporter accepts only that
certificate, so nobody on the network can read the reports or pose as your
console. The join page itself opens as plain HTTP so a browser shows no
warning, which is why the command is what you send: see
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#how-the-console-is-protected).

**Credentials.** A join link carries a single-use code that expires within the
hour (`--invite-minutes`, at most 60). The reporter spends it once and receives
its own device token, which it keeps in a private file (mode 600) under
`~/.agent-console/reporter/`. The token is never printed, never put in a URL and
never shown on a screen; the hub stores only a SHA-256 verifier of it. **Remove**
on the Team view revokes a machine at once (its reporter stops and says why),
and what it already reported stays, marked as removed.

**Storage.** The hub keeps 8 days of usage (`--retention-days`) in
`~/.agent-console/hub/` (`--state-dir`), one file of metadata records per day.
Nothing leaves that directory.

### The reporter

**Add a machine** and the join page generate a command for the versioned
GitHub release. Until v0.4.1 packages are published, copy the join link and
run these commands from a current source checkout on the reporting computer:

```sh
node bin/agent-console.mjs join '<join link>'
node bin/agent-console.mjs report
node bin/agent-console.mjs leave
```

`join` enrols this computer, then keeps reporting. `report` keeps reporting after
a restart, with no new link. `stop` stops a reporter running in the background
and keeps the enrolment. `leave` stops any reporter, tells the console this
computer has left, and deletes everything the enrolment left on this computer.
Joining the same console again keeps this computer's entry and history, rather
than adding a second machine with the same name; after `leave`, that holds when
the new link names the same person and machine. Do not shorten a release
command to `npx agent-console`: that name refers to a different, unrelated
package in the public registry.

The command **Add a machine** gives, and the join page's, starts with
`node -e '<check>'`: a short check that downloads the release file and its
`SHA256SUMS` from GitHub, runs nothing unless the file's SHA-256 matches,
keeps the checked file in `~/.agent-console/releases/`, and then runs it.
Before running a command you were sent, compare its check with the published
one ([The check in every command](#the-check-in-every-command)). The
reporter's own restart line names that checked file.

Options: `--name` (what to call this computer), `--interval <seconds>` (2 to
3600; over 60 the console shows it as reporting periodically), `--background`,
`--once`, `--state-dir`, `--home`, `--claude-root`, `--codex-root`,
`--share-project-names`, `--share-alerts`, `--share-tool-activity`, `--json`.
An unknown option is refused, not ignored.

Two more opt-ins, each off unless passed on that run, let the console see
more of this computer. `--share-alerts` sends the alerts it raises (repeated
tool call, burn spike, spending without a tool success) as a kind, a minute, a
salted session hash and one count; without it the console names this computer
as *not watched* rather than showing its silence as "no alert".
`--share-tool-activity` sends how many tool calls each session made per minute
by kind (read, edit, shell, search, web, agent, mcp, other) and how many results
were errors — never a tool's name, its arguments or output, a path, or an MCP
server's name. Every report says which of the two its run shares: run without
one and the console shows that computer's alerts or activity as unavailable
from then on, never as zero. What the console has not yet acknowledged waits
beside the reporter's cursor and is sent again, and counted once.

`--background` keeps reporting after the window closes. To start reporting at
every login, [docs/BACKGROUND.md](docs/BACKGROUND.md) has launchd, systemd and
Task Scheduler examples.

## Privacy, precisely

What leaves a reporting computer, per usage event: the tool (`claude-code` or
`codex`), the model id, the minute it happened, the four token counts, whether
it was a subagent and whether it continues a message already counted, and
HMAC-SHA256 hashes of the session, its parent and the project folder. Session
hashes are keyed by a salt the hub shares only with the machines that join it,
so a copied transcript is recognised; project hashes are keyed by a secret that
never leaves the reporting computer. The machine's name is whatever the
person who made the link typed (or `--name` when joining). With
`--share-project-names` on that run, also the last part of each project
folder's name, reduced to letters, digits and dashes; run without it and names
stop at once. With `--share-alerts`, each alert as a kind, a minute, a session
hash and a count; with `--share-tool-activity`, tool calls per minute counted
by one of eight kinds, and results counted as ok or error.

What never leaves: prompts, replies, thinking, tool input and output, file
paths, file names, file contents, git branches, command lines, credentials.

On the hub's own computer the console also shows local project names and
branches, read from its own disk, shown only to the signed-in console, never
stored with the records and never sent anywhere.

The proof is `test/hub-e2e.test.js`: synthetic transcripts in the tools' real
formats, with canaries in every private field, go through a real reporter
process and a real hub process; a relay holding the hub's certificate records
every request in plain text, and the test checks the wire, the hub's files, the
reporter's files and the console's own payload for every canary. The
field-by-field contract is [docs/COLLECTOR-CONTRACT.md](docs/COLLECTOR-CONTRACT.md).

## Troubleshooting

**The console opened on a port other than 6787.** Another program had 6787,
so the console took the next free port and printed the address it used. If
Agent Console itself is already running there, a second start says so and
opens that one instead, once that console has proved it is yours (it never sends
it the console's key). A port you choose with `--port` is never changed: if
it is busy you are told to pick another.

**The console says "Sign in to this console".** Press **Print a new sign-in
link** on that page, and use the link that appears in the console's terminal
window. Running the start command again with `--open` works too.

**The reporter says "the hub is pacing uploads" or "catching up".** A computer
joining with a lot of history sends it in batches, and the hub paces them. Leave
the window open: every batch that arrived is kept, and the console shows the
machine as "catching up · N of M records" until it is done.

**The other computer cannot reach the console.** Check, in order: the console
was started with `--listen 0.0.0.0`; both computers are on the same network
(not a guest network); the address in the link is still this computer's address
(it can change when you change networks, so make a new link); and the firewall
allows Node.js to accept connections on the reporting port. macOS asks the
first time (choose *Allow*; or System Settings → Network → Firewall → Options),
Windows asks the same (allow *Private networks*), and on Linux with `ufw`:
`sudo ufw allow 6788/tcp`.

**"The machine at … is not the console that made this link."** The certificate
at that address is not the one named in the link: the link is for another
console, or another machine is answering at that address. Nothing was sent. Ask
for a new link.

**"This join code is not valid" or "has expired."** Each link works once, for at
most an hour. Press **Add a machine** again and send the new link.

**A machine shows "Silent since …".** Its reporter stopped: the window was
closed, the computer slept, or it changed networks. On that computer run the
`report` command (the join page shows it), with no new link. If it says the hub
no longer accepts it, it was removed: send it a new link.

**A machine shows "Reconnecting".** The console restarted moments ago, and the
machine was reporting when it stopped. Its reporter comes back within about a
minute; nothing needs doing.

**The console's reporting port changed.** Reporters look for the console on
the ten ports either side of the one they joined on, and move by themselves.
Beyond that, start the console with `--report-port` set to the old port, or send
new links. A reporter that says the console's certificate changed has found a
different console at that address (or one set up again from scratch): send it
a new link.

**A machine shows "Joined — waiting for its first report."** It has joined but
its reporter has not delivered yet; if it stays that way, the reporter window
was closed right after joining.

**The numbers look low.** The console keeps 8 days, and the first start reads
only transcripts written in that window. Claude Code and Codex must be writing
their usual logs (`~/.claude/projects`, `~/.codex/sessions`); if yours live
elsewhere, pass `--claude-root` / `--codex-root`.

**`npx` or `node` is "not found".** Node.js is not installed, or the terminal
was opened before it was. Install it from nodejs.org and open a new terminal.

## Options

```sh
node bin/agent-console.mjs --help          # the console
node bin/agent-console.mjs join --help     # the reporter
```

| Console option | Default / purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `--open` | open the console in the browser, signed in |
| `--port <n>` | `6787`: the console, on this computer only |
| `--report-port <n>` | the port above it (`6788`): where other computers join and report |
| `--listen <address>` | `127.0.0.1`; `0.0.0.0` lets other computers reach the reporting port |
| `--advertise <address>` | the address join links carry, as other computers reach this one (WSL, several network adapters, a port forward) |
| `--allow-public` | accept reports from outside private networks |
| `--allow-cgnat` | also accept 100.64.0.0/10 (Tailscale, carrier-grade NAT) |
| `--demo` | a synthetic team; reads nothing, accepts no machine |
| `--name <text>`, `--person <text>` | this computer's name, and whose it is, on the console (`This machine`, `You`) |
| `--no-local` | do not read this computer (a hub on a server) |
| `--state-dir <path>` | `~/.agent-console/hub` |
| `--retention-days <n>` | `8` (1–90) |
| `--invite-minutes <n>` | `30` (at most 60) |
| `--claude-root`, `--codex-root` | where this computer's transcripts are, instead of the folders found below |
| `--poll-ms <n>` | `2000`: how often this computer's transcripts are read, in milliseconds (1000 or more) |
| `--json` | print launch details as JSON and keep running |

Some console options can also be set in the environment, for a console that a
service or `docker run -e` starts. An option given on the command line wins
over its variable. A yes/no variable counts as on for `1`, `true`, `yes` or `on`.

| Variable | Same as |
| --- | --- |
| `AGENT_CONSOLE_PORT` | `--port` |
| `AGENT_CONSOLE_REPORT_PORT` | `--report-port` |
| `AGENT_CONSOLE_LISTEN` | `--listen` |
| `AGENT_CONSOLE_ADVERTISE` | `--advertise` |
| `AGENT_CONSOLE_ALLOW_CGNAT` | `--allow-cgnat` (yes/no) |
| `AGENT_CONSOLE_DEMO` | `--demo` (yes/no) |
| `AGENT_CONSOLE_NAME_MACHINE` | `--name` |
| `AGENT_CONSOLE_NO_LOCAL` | `--no-local` (yes/no) |
| `AGENT_CONSOLE_STATE_DIR` | `--state-dir` |
| `AGENT_CONSOLE_RETENTION_DAYS` | `--retention-days` |
| `AGENT_CONSOLE_CLAUDE_ROOT` | `--claude-root` |
| `AGENT_CONSOLE_CODEX_ROOT` | `--codex-root` |
| `AGENT_CONSOLE_HOME` | `--home <path>`: read that home folder's transcripts instead of yours |
| `AGENT_CONSOLE_DESKTOP_ALERTS` | `--desktop-alerts` (yes/no) |
| `AGENT_CONSOLE_ALERT_REPEAT` | `--alert-repeat` |
| `AGENT_CONSOLE_ALERT_SPIKE_FACTOR` | `--alert-spike-factor` |
| `AGENT_CONSOLE_ALERT_STALL_MINUTES` | `--alert-stall-minutes` |
| `AGENT_CONSOLE_INTEROP` | `--interop` (yes/no) |
| `AGENT_CONSOLE_POLL_MS` | `--poll-ms` |

`--open`, `--allow-public`, `--person`, `--invite-minutes` and `--json` have no
variable. The reporter reads two: `AGENT_CONSOLE_REPORTER_DIR` in place of its
default `--state-dir` (`~/.agent-console/reporter`), and `AGENT_CONSOLE_TOKEN`,
which it sends in place of its enrolment's device token. `AGENT_CONSOLE_NAME`
and `AGENT_CONSOLE_VENDOR` change the product and vendor names that the console
and the reporter print. `AGENT_CONSOLE_PACKAGE` is set by the check in a
join command, for the reporter it starts; it is not one to set yourself.

The console and the reporter find transcripts where Claude Code and Codex put
them: Claude Code's `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` (its `projects` folder; a
comma-separated list is read in full) when it is set, `~/.claude/projects`,
and `~/.config/claude/projects` where it exists; Codex's `CODEX_HOME` (its
`sessions` folder, and `archived_sessions`, where Codex moves a thread it
archives) when it is set, and `~/.codex/sessions` with `~/.codex/archived_sessions`.
`--claude-root` / `--codex-root` (or their variables) replace their tool's
list. With `--home`, these two variables are not used: that home stands for
another computer's layout. The console names every folder it read, and says
so in its window when it finds nothing. (`policy` reads `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`
too, to stay out of your user-level Claude Code settings.)

The installers and the standalone executable have their own:
`AGENT_CONSOLE_VERSION`, `AGENT_CONSOLE_INSTALL_DIR` and
`AGENT_CONSOLE_NO_MODIFY_PATH` ([standalone-install.md](docs/standalone-install.md)),
and `AGENT_CONSOLE_CACHE_DIR` ([executables.md](docs/executables.md#what-it-does-on-your-computer)).

## Upgrading a hub

Stop its running console processes before upgrading. Keep each hub's state
directory on a local disk that supports hard links. One running hub owns a
state directory, even if another start chooses different ports; use a separate
`--state-dir` for a separate hub. Older versions must be stopped because they
do not honor the new ownership lock.

## Uninstall

Stop what runs, remove the program, then its data. In short: `leave` on each
reporting computer (and remove any login service you set up from
[BACKGROUND.md](docs/BACKGROUND.md) first), `policy remove` in each repository
you applied a policy to, then `npm uninstall -g @lockedinlabs/agent-console`,
`brew uninstall agent-console`, or delete the executable the installer put in
place; last, delete `~/.agent-console/` and the executable's cache folder.
[docs/uninstall.md](docs/uninstall.md) lists every file, folder and background
item, per system.

## Verify a release

From 0.2.1 on, CI builds each release from its tag
([release.yml](.github/workflows/release.yml)); nothing is built on anyone's
own machine. The files it attaches (the package, the standalone executables
and their archives, and the SBOMs) are each listed in the release's
`SHA256SUMS` and covered by a signed build provenance attestation. To check
the v0.4.1 package, with `SHA256SUMS` downloaded beside it:

```sh
shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS --ignore-missing        # macOS, Linux
Get-FileHash lockedinlabs-agent-console-0.4.1.tgz   # Windows PowerShell: compare with SHA256SUMS
gh attestation verify lockedinlabs-agent-console-0.4.1.tgz -R LockedinLabs-AI/agent-console
```

The standalone executables ([docs/executables.md](docs/executables.md)) are
checked the same way, each by its own file name: `agent-console-darwin-arm64`,
`agent-console-darwin-x64`, `agent-console-linux-x64`,
`agent-console-linux-arm64` and `agent-console-win32-x64.exe`, and a `.tar.gz`
of each of the first four.

**SBOMs.** From 0.4.1, the package and each executable have a CycloneDX SBOM
on the release page (`*.cdx.json`), attested against the files it describes.
To check that a file's SBOM is the one the release workflow made:

```sh
gh attestation verify lockedinlabs-agent-console-0.4.1.tgz -R LockedinLabs-AI/agent-console \
  --predicate-type https://cyclonedx.org/bom
```

**npm provenance.** The package is not on the npm registry yet. When it is,
[npm-publish.yml](.github/workflows/npm-publish.yml) publishes that same
attested file with npm provenance, after checking it against `SHA256SUMS`, its
attestation and the tag; `npm audit signatures` checks the provenance in a
project that installs it.

**Signing.** A checksum or build attestation does not establish Apple signing
or notarization on its own. From v0.4.1, the macOS executables are signed
with an Apple Developer ID and notarized by Apple
([details](docs/executables.md#signed-or-not-plainly)); check the exact
release's notes and the downloaded file's signature before relying on a
signing claim. The Windows executable is not code-signed.

**Releases before the move.** v0.1.0 through v0.3.0 were attested under the
project's original repository name, which remains their identity: check those
files with
`gh attestation verify <file> --owner SamSnead85 --signer-repo SamSnead85/agent-console`.

## The check in every command

This section describes the v0.4.1 source. For a packaged version, use that
release's README and notes: the verification check can change between versions.

Every command the console or the join page prints starts with
`node -e '<check>'`: a short program that downloads the release file and the
release's `SHA256SUMS` from GitHub over HTTPS, and runs nothing unless the
file's SHA-256 is the one listed. Before you run a command someone sent you,
compare its check with the published one, not only its first words. The
check's SHA-256 is:

```text
77aea0b4b487f2e39065b5739377f16678d6977b0fbd6d1ab0ef901052e581bc
```

This command prints the SHA-256 of the check in any command you paste into it,
without running anything. Paste the command, press Return, then Ctrl+D
(Ctrl+Z and Return in PowerShell):

```sh
node -e "let s='';process.stdin.on('data',d=>s+=d).on('end',()=>console.log(require('crypto').createHash('sha256').update(s.split(String.fromCharCode(39))[1]).digest('hex')))"
```

The check itself, verbatim:

```text
const[u,...a]=process.argv.slice(1),p=require(`path`),n=p.basename(u),g=x=>fetch(x).then(r=>{if(!r.ok)throw Error(x+` answered `+r.status);return r.arrayBuffer()}).then(Buffer.from);(async()=>{if(!/^https:[/][/]github[.]com[/][A-Za-z0-9_.-]+[/][A-Za-z0-9_.-]+[/]releases[/]download[/]v[0-9.]+[/][A-Za-z0-9_.-]+[.]tgz(?![^])/.test(u))throw Error(`not a release file: `+u);const t=String(await g(p.posix.dirname(u)+`/SHA256SUMS`)).split(/[^0-9A-Za-z._-]+/),b=await g(u),h=require(`crypto`).createHash(`sha256`).update(b).digest(`hex`);if(h!==t[t.indexOf(n)-1])throw Error(n+` does not match the release SHA256SUMS; nothing was run`);const f=require(`fs`),d=p.join(require(`os`).homedir(),`.agent-console`,`releases`),k=p.join(d,n),w=process.platform==`win32`,q=String.fromCharCode(34);f.mkdirSync(d,{recursive:true});f.writeFileSync(k,b);console.error(n+` matches the release SHA256SUMS: `+h);const r=require(`child_process`).spawnSync(w?[`npx`,`--yes`,`file:`+k,...a].map(x=>q+x+q).join(` `):`npx`,w?[]:[`--yes`,`file:`+k,...a],{stdio:`inherit`,shell:w,env:{...process.env,AGENT_CONSOLE_PACKAGE:k}});process.exit(r.status??1)})().catch(e=>{const c=e.cause;console.error(String(e.message)+(c?` (`+String(c.code||c.name||c)+`)`:``));if(c)console.error(`Behind a proxy or TLS inspection? Set HTTPS_PROXY and NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1, and NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=<your company root .pem>`);process.exit(1)})
```

## Development

See the [architecture and trust boundaries](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for data flow, component ownership and the CI/release path.

```sh
npm run lint           # JavaScript syntax and JSON validity
npm test               # the whole suite, including the multi-machine end-to-end tests
npm run smoke:pack     # pack, install into a scratch prefix, start it in demo mode
```

These checks need no dependencies installed. CI runs the tests and package
smoke on macOS, Linux and Windows, Node 22 and 24, and the syntax check on
Linux with Node 24. Native builds use separately locked tooling; see
