# Shipyard
https://www.berthd.app/
Run coding agents on your dev boxes, and work with them as if they were on
your laptop.

Shipyard connects a laptop to any number of development machines (a VPS, a
cloud VM, a desktop under your desk) and gives each repository on them
worktrees, terminals, agents, dev servers and automations. The agents run on
the boxes, so closing the app, sleeping the laptop or losing Wi-Fi never
stops them; the app is a view you can close and reopen at any time.

- **Workspaces per worktree**: terminals (ghostty-web), splits, and browser
  tabs onto each worktree's dev server, at private URLs like
  `http://checkout.shop.devl.localhost:1377/`.
- **Agents you can see and steer**: Claude Code, Codex and others, with a
  kanban of who needs you, a review inbox for finished work, and
  orchestration (prompt, wait, check, loop, hand off) from the app, the CLI,
  or other agents.
- **Projects set up the same everywhere**: each worktree gets its own ports,
  environment, services, hooks and flows, from the repository's
  `.berth/config.json`, a shareable kit, or the box's own config.
- **Automations**: Zapier-style flows on events, schedules or GitHub
  activity, running on the box; plus plain shell hooks and `before:` gates.
- **Plugins**: React plugins for the app, with built-ins for git changes,
  pull requests, dev servers, box monitoring, activity and notes.
- **Boxes without the fuss**: pinned mutual TLS, pairing by link, boxes on
  other tailnets, self-upgrade over Shipyard's own connection, and a phone
  companion served by each box.

## Pieces

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `berthd` | The daemon on each box: worktrees, sessions (tmux), services, hooks, flows, kits. |
| `berth` | The laptop CLI and background agent: connections, private URLs, the app's API. |
| `app/` | The desktop app (Tauri, React, coss ui). |
| `plugins/` | Built-in plugins, written against `packages/plugin-sdk`. |

## Getting started

**On each box**, as the user your agents will run as:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://berthd.app/install | sh
```

It downloads `berthd` from the [latest release](https://github.com/cosscom/shipyard/releases/latest),
checks it against the release's checksums, installs it for that user (no
root), starts it as a systemd user service (launchd on macOS), installs the
hooks that let Claude Code, Codex and Cursor report their state
(`--no-integrations` skips them), and prints a pairing link. The link works
once, for ten minutes. Run it again to upgrade in place; `sh -s -- --help`
lists the options.

**On your Mac**, [download Shipyard](https://github.com/cosscom/shipyard/releases/latest/download/Berth-macos-universal.dmg)
(`Berth-macos-universal.dmg`, for Apple silicon and Intel, signed and
notarized), drag it to Applications and open it. The app carries the
`berth` CLI and the Linux daemons `berth add ssh` uploads, and offers to
start the laptop agent when it isn't running. It updates itself: new
releases download in the background, and **Restart to update** in the
status bar or Settings → About applies one; it never restarts on its own,
and restarting never stops an agent.

Or, with Homebrew (it links `berth` into Homebrew's `bin` too):

```sh
brew tap cosscom/shipyard https://github.com/cosscom/shipyard
brew install --cask cosscom/shipyard/shipyard
```

For `berth` in a terminal, **Settings → General → Command line → Install**
links `~/.local/bin/berth` to the app's copy (it asks first). On a Linux
laptop, or for the CLI alone, download it from the release (use
`linux-arm64`, `darwin-arm64` or `darwin-amd64` to match):

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
curl -fsSL https://github.com/cosscom/shipyard/releases/latest/download/berth-linux-amd64.tar.gz | tar -xz -C ~/.local/bin
```

Paste the box's link into the app (**Add a box**), or:

```sh
berth pair 'berth://100.101.102.103:7444?code=…&fp=…'
```

Instead of the install line, `berth add ssh` can install and pair a box over
SSH in one step. Then add a project and start an agent, in the app or here:

```sh
berth add ssh me@my-box                    # or: install on the box over SSH, and pair
berth location add my-box/app ~/work/app
berth task new my-box/app/fix-login --agent claude --prompt "Fix the login redirect"
```

`berth help` lists every command; every listing takes `--json`.

### Build from source

With Go 1.27, Node 22, pnpm and Rust. `make all` builds `berth` and
`berthd` into `bin/`; the app runs the clone's `bin/berth` for the laptop
agent:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cosscom/shipyard
cd berthd && make all
cd app && pnpm install && pnpm tauri dev
```

`make app-build` builds `Shipyard.app` and its disk image, with the CLI and the
Linux daemons inside.
